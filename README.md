# Pirple_myFavoriteSong
This contains all the attributes that you could use to describe my favorite song. That is: all of it's details. These are attributes like "Artist", "Date Released", "Genre", "Duration", etc.  In my text editor, created an empty file and named it song.kt  Now, within that file, listed all of the attributes of the song, (one after another on separate lines), by creating variables for each attribute, and giving each variable a value. Tried to use as many different data types as I can!  Now, below my declarations, printed the value of each variable to the console, one after another. I also made use of comments
